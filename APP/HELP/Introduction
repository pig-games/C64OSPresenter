{$f6}{$f1}Introduction

Presenter is a feature-rich presentation application for our favorite 8bit micro. It has been specifically written to run under c64os (our favorite 8bit OS).

Presenter uses presentation files with the extension '.prs'.
These files are regular SEC files that uses lower/upper case PETSCII with command codes that define the behavior of the presentation.
It also supports template files that contain reusable content that can be included in presentations.
The command set for .prs files is documented in a 'built in' tutorial presentation.
