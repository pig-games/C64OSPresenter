{$f6}{$f1}Slide sections

Presenter supports multiple 'sections' per slide.

Sections can be used to 'build' a slide in multiple steps. This is useful, for example, to show individual bullets, pausing after each bullet.

When stepping forward through the presentation each section of a slide is shown, pausing after each section.

When stepping backwards through the presentation, the presentation always moves to the start of a slide. So when multiple sections of a slide have been shown already, moving backwards moves to the start of the slide. When the presentations is already at
the start of any slide (with or without sections) the previous slide is shown.
