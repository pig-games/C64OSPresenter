This is the start of a simple presentation program for [C64OS](https://c64os.com). 

It started off as a port of the C64 native presentation program https://github.com/gnacu/presenter.
By now it has new file format that enables more features.

The file format is a very simple petscii format that can be created and edited with standard C64 text editors like Novatext.

# File format
Presentation files are sequence files that are required to have the '.prs' file extension.
The bulk of a presentation file consists of standard petsii text.

## Comment section

At the start of a presentation it is allowed to include a text segment that provides comments about the presentation. This can be any text of any lenght. This segment is closed by the first __!s__\<CR\> command. This must be the first command of each presentation file.

## Fields
The presenter app supports 'fields' that can be used to add short (max 40 character) reusable text fragments that can be added anywhere in the content of a slide with the __!Fff__ command described in the chapter [[#Slides]].

There are three types of fields:
1. User defined fields
2. Dynamic fields

User defined fields have to be explicitely specified in using the __!Dff__ command. 
The values of dynamic fields are automatically generated by the presenter app when they are encountered in a slide.

### User defined fields
These fields can be defined by the creator of the presentation. This is done by using the __!Dff__ command (typically immediately after a __!S__ command). The 'names' can be at most two characters long. Note that there is currently a maximum of 6 user defined fields. 

The following fields are 'standard' by convention: 
* __TI__: Title, this field is used to contain the title of the presentation
* __ST__: Section title, this field is used to contain the title of a section of slides. 
* __AU__: Author, this is field is used to contain the name of the author of the presentation
* __CD__: Creation Date, this field is used to contain the creation date of the presentation

One way to allow for one more field is by using either the __TI__ or __ST__ field for both the title of the presentation and the title of a section of slides (if both titles are not used at the same time anywhere).
### Dynamic fields
These fields are always available and don't need any definition.
The following fields are defined:
* __PD__: Presentation date, which is the current date when the presentation is running.
* 

## Slides
The bulk of a slide's content consists of standard petsii text. In addition to this a set of commands can be used that are always prefixed with an '!' (to have an ! in the output just use !! in the slide content).

The following commands are supported:
* __!s__\<CR\>: Start of a new slide/section. This command pauses the presentation, and when 'Next' is triggered, will clear the screen and start any new content from the top-left of the screen. Note that this command needs to end with a CR (carriage return).
* __!p__: Pause the current slide. This command pauses the presentation and when 'Next' is triggered, will continue any new content at the paused position.
* **!c**xx: Changes the text color. It requires a two digit decimal number, between 0 and 15, immediately after the command.
* **!b**xx: Changes the background color. It requires a two digit decimal number, between 0 and 15, immediately after the command. This command is mostly useful right after a __!s__ or __!p__ command. In the latter scenario it allows for changing background color after each pause, note that the full screen background is changed.
* **!l**xxyy: Changes the ouput location. This command requires a two digit decimal numbers, the first for the new X coordinate (or column) the second for the new Y coordinate (or row). Note that as the screen has a resolution of 40x25 characters these values have to be between 0-39 and 0-24 respectively.
* **!w**xxyy: Changes the output 'window'. This command is very similar to the **!l**xxyy command. However, it also 'remembers' the x-coordinate for any new lines following its use. This is very useful for adding 'windows' or 'blocks' of content to a slide, when combined with the __!p__ can be used creatively for 'builds' or 'animations' of 'blocks' of content anywhere in the slide while keeping the content 'around' it constant.
* **!t**xx: Set the output 'tab' to possition xx. This command requires a two digit decimal number, between 0, 38 (the new start column). This command is similar to the **!w**xxyy command but it only sets the tab (indent) for new lines in the output. It can also be used there for to reset the indent after a **!w**xxyy to zero.
* __!\___: Clear the line to the right from the current position. This is useful in combination with the **!w**xxyy command, when writing content over existing content that may be longer.
* **!d**ff\<value\>\<CR\>: _(will be available in a later version)_ Defines a value for a field specified by a two character 'name' (ff). This command is typically used directly after a __!s__ command to define (new) field values that can be used in the slide/section following that command. Note that this command needs to end with a CR (carriage return).
* **!f**ff: _(will be available in a later version)_ Is replaced by the value of the field specified by the two character 'name' (ff). These fields are described in chapter [[#Header]] (above).
* **!i**\<cmd\>\<CR\>: _(will be available in a later version)_ Adds image support to presentations.  Note that this command needs to end with a CR (carriage return/new line). The __!i__ needs to be followed (before the CR) by a sub-command (\<cmd\>):
  * **!il**\<path\>: Loads a image file, specified with \<path\>, to the graphics screen. 
  * **!i**s: Show the currently loaded image (if available).
  * **!i**h: Hide the currently loaded image and therefore show the current slide again.
* **!m**\<cmd\>\<CR\>: _(will be available in a later version)_ Adds SID music support to presentations. Note that there because of memory limits, SID files have to be relatively small to work inside a presentation. Note that this command has no visual impact on the slide. Note that this command needs to end with a CR (carriage return). The __!m__ needs to be followed (before the CR) by a sub-command (\<cmd\>):
  *  **!m**l\<path\>: Loads a SID file, specified with \<path\>. 
  *  **!m**sxx: Sets the playhead to the start of a numbered soung, using xx = 0 this returns the 'play head' to the start of the SID file.
  *  **!m**pss?: Starts playing the currently loaded SID file. It can optionally specify a maximum number of seconds to play the song.
  *  **!m**e: Stops playing the currently playing SID file.
* __!e__: Marks the end of the presentation.
